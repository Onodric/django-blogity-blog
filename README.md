# Personal Blog Server

This is a project I created because I needed a space to display my 
writings, mostly small write-ups of meetings. Maybe some slides or notes 
for presentations in future.

## Inspiration

This was based on CodingEntrepreneurs' Try Django 1.9 series. There are 
significant modifications. Styles are based on my own portfolio site, and 
this project makes extensive use of class-based models and views. A general
 upgrade from 1.9 to 1.11. 
 
 This project will also support markdown, and I hope to integrate photos as
  well.
